# 🌊 eternal-spring

A tranquil number-guessing mini game inspired by the classic Chinese RPG **Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Scar of Sky (轩辕剑叁外传：天之痕)**.

While building this project, I traced the game's core logic back to the traditional "Bulls and Cows" game — a discovery that added an extra layer of connection to this nostalgic journey.

## 💬 About

This project was created as a lighthearted exercise to polish React fundamentals, practice component structuring and design an interactive mini-world.

Again, special thanks to the nostalgic inspiration from the classic RPG -- **Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Scar of Sky (轩辕剑叁外传：天之痕)**.

The background music is directly borrowed from the number guessing mini-game map, bringing a personal touch of memory into this project.
